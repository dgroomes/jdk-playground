## Overview

I want a Java program that can call into a native library written in C. I've wanted to do this for a long time and `jextract`
has had a few years to mature so now is a good time to try it out.

[Apache Lucene is using](https://github.com/apache/lucene/commit/3b9c728ab558255eb8329a017b9d235611d7b142) Java's exciting
[Foreign Function & Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/442) which is a preview feature in Java 21. This is cool.
I want to use `jextract` to generate Java bindings for a native library and then use the Foreign Function API to call
the library from Java code.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build the C library, the Java program and run the Java program.

1. Pre-requisite: Java 21
   * The source code is authored for Java 21 and must be compiled with Java 21. It's up to you if you want to run Gradle
     on Java 21 or earlier. Gradle does not technically endorse support for running on Java 21 yet. See the "Support for
     running Gradle" section in the Gradle [Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html).
2. Use a matching `jextract` distribution
   * [Download one from OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/jextract/). 
3. Compile the C library
   * ```shell
     clang -dynamiclib -o lucky_number.dylib lucky_number.c
     ```
4. Extract the Java bindings
   * ```shell
     jextract --source \
      --output src/main/java \
      --target-package dgroomes.bindings \
      -I "$PWD" \
      -l "$PWD/lucky_number.dylib" \
     lucky_number.h
     ```
   * Glance over the generated code. Specifically, notice how the `RuntimeHelper` class hard codes to the fully qualified
     path of the dynamic shared library to load it. 
   * ```java
     final class RuntimeHelper {
       // ... omitted ...
       static {
           System.load("/Users/dave/repos/personal/jdk-playground/jextract/lucky_number.dylib");
           SymbolLookup loaderLookup = SymbolLookup.loaderLookup();
           SYMBOL_LOOKUP = name -> loaderLookup.find(name).or(() -> LINKER.defaultLookup().find(name));
       }
       // ... omitted ...
     }
     ```
   * The path will be different on your machine. This makes the generated code not portable. But for this project, we
     don't have a need for portability.
5. Compile the Java program
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew installDist
     ```
6. Run the Java program
   * Make sure you are using Java 21.
   * ```shell
     build/install/jextract/bin/jextract
     ```
   * It should look something like this:
     ```text
     $ build/install/jextract/bin/jextract
     Let's call native code from Java! Here we go...
     Your lucky number is 123.
     ```


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Engage foreign memory. Do something with C strings, structs, and/or pointers.
* [ ] Modularize the program (idiomatic). I was having some Gradle issue when I tried. I think it's a Gradle toolchain
  defect.
* [ ] Consider baking the dylib into the program distribution. Not a big deal.
